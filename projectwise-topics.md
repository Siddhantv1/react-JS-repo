useEffect , useRef and useCallback

> useEffect is a custom hook in React which allows us to perform certain effects 
> in functions and components. it needs 2 parameters, a ==`callback`== and a ==`dependency array`==

a dependency array makes sure that the base case of constant values are returned if 
there is any mistake aur maybe just default values are going to be presented
the callback is the real stuff which makes the wanted changes, its good to have a custom hook in
react, as it helps to ease the access of functions and decreases effort
